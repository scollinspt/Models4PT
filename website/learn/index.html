<h1>Learn about DAGs and DAGitty</h1>
	
<p>
	DAGitty's functions are described <a href="../manual-3.x.pdf">in the 
	PDF manual</a>.	However, the manual provides only very little introduction to DAGs themselves.
	My recommended resource for learning about them is the book 
	<a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/PRIMER/">"Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer"</a>
	by Pearl, Glymour and Jewell. The Primer also contains exercises, many of which can be solved
	using DAGitty and the DAGitty R package. See 
	the <a href="http://www.dagitty.net/primer/">R vignette for the Primer.</a>
</p>

<p> 
	If you are just getting started with DAGitty and the <a href="../manual-3.x.pdf">manual</a> 
	seems like a little much, check out
	the <a href="primer/Dagitty-Cheat-Sheet.pdf">DAGitty primer/cheat sheet</a>.
	It will get you started in using DAGitty to draw and evaluate causal diagrams.
</p>

<p>
	Below you can find some other resources for learning about DAGs and DAGitty. 
</p>

<h2>Interactive Tutorials and Examples</h2>

<p>
	This is a growing list of interactive tutorials about DAGs that are built in DAGitty itself.
</p>

			<h3><a href="graphs/index.html">DAG Terminology</a></h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Parents, children, ancestors, descendants ... If you are confused
				by all the graph terminology, 
				<a href="graphs/index.html">here's our little game</a> to learn
				about it!</li>
				<li>What is a confounder? A mediator? A proxy confounder? These are
				all concepts that can only be defined by invoking causal language.
				Learn in our 
				<a href="graphs/roles.html">tutorial on covariate roles</a> how
				to spot such variables in DAGs.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3><a href="dsep/index.html">d-Separation</a></h3>
			
			<ul><li>
				The article <a href="dsep/index.html">d-Separation Without
				Tears</a>, adapted from Judea Pearl's textbook 
				"Causality", explains the key concept of d-separation in 
				simpler words.
			</li></ul>

			
			<h3><a href="graphs/table2-fallacy.html">The Table II Fallacy</a></h3>
			
			<ul><li>
				<a href="graphs/table2-fallacy.html">"Table II Fallacy"</a> is a 
				nice idiom introduced by
				<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aje/kws412">Westreich and Greenland</a>.
				It refers to the problems with interpreting the 
				coefficients in a multiple regression model causally,
				including the widespread belief that coefficients in
				such models are "mutually adjusted". Learn 
				<a href="graphs/table2-fallacy.html">here</a> how to
				properly interpret coefficients in multiple regression
				models!
			</li></ul>


			<h3><a href="simpson/index.html">The Simpson Machine</a></h3>
			
			<ul><li>
				The <a href="simpson/index.html">Simpson Machine</a> illustrates
				which causal structures can lead to Simpson's paradox, and
				that valid covariate adjustment sets cannot be found without
				causal considerations.
			</li></ul>
			
			<h3><a href="singledoor/index.html">The Single-Door Criterion</a></h3>
			
			<ul><li>
				The <a href="singledoor/index.html">Single-Door Criterion</a> can be used to
				identify structural parameters (direct effects) in structural
				equation models, even when the model as a whole is not identifiable.
				This short tutorial explains what the single-door criterion can,
				and cannot, do.
			</li></ul>

			<p>
				<strong>Make your own example!</strong> If you know a little HTML
				and JavaScript, you can make your own interactive example like
				above. <a href="growyourown.html">Read here how!</a>

<h2>DAGitty video tutorials</h2>

<p>
Some nice people have gone through the effort to make tutorial videos about how to use
dagitty. They are mainly based on 2.x versions, but still worth checking out:

<h2>Introduction Literature on DAGs</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2515245917745629">Thinking Clearly About Correlations and Causation</a> by Julia Rohrer is an excellent 
introduction, written from a Psychology perspective but useful for anyone.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/soc/faculty/pages/docs/elwert/Elwert%202013.pdf">Graphical Causal Models</a> by Felix Elwert is another nicely written introduction to DAGs, aimed at social scientists.
</li>

<li>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09104">Causal Inference and Data-Fusion in Econometrics</a> is, as the title suggests, an introduction to the topic that's aimed at Econometricians, but I would recommend it for a broader audience as it covers many more recent developments in the field as well.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/8/70/">"Reducing bias through Directed Acyclic Graphs"</a> by Ian Shrier and Robert W. Platt is a nicely written piece on the specific issue of covariate adjustment.
</li>

<li>
Epidemiologists may also like 
<a href="http://sfi.nr.no/sfi/images/d/d8/Greenland.pdf">Causal Diagrams for Epidemiologic Research</a> by Greenland, Pearl, and Robins.
</li>

<li>
And then there's <a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/home.htm">Judea Pearl's</a> textbook "Causality",
which is comprehensive and thought-provoking, but not extremely accessible.
</li>
