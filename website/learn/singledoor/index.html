<h1>The Single-Door Criterion</h1>
<p>Based on a <a href="http://www2.gsu.edu/~mkteer/semnet.html">SEMnet</a> discussion
with <a href="https://leibniz-psychology.org/mitarbeiter/profil-holger-steinmetz/">Holger Steinmetz</a>.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The single-door criterion helps to identify single path coefficients in structural
equation models (SEMs). It is especially useful in cases where the SEM as a whole
is not  "identified", i.e., where it is impossible to find a unique set of coefficients
for the whole model that best explains the observed covariance matrix. In this 
tutorial, we illustrate the single-door criterion with four examples.
</p>

<h2>Definition of the single-door criterion</h2>

<p>
Let G be any recursive causal graph in which 
&alpha; is the path coefficient associated with link X &rarr; Y,
and let G<sub>&alpha;</sub>
 denote the diagram that results when X &rarr; Y is deleted from G.
The coefficient &alpha; is identifiable if there exists a set of variables Z 
such that
<ol>
<li>Z contains no descendant of Y and</li>
<li>Z <a href="../dsep/index.html">d-separates</a> X from Y in G<sub>&alpha;</sub></li>
</ol>
If Z satisfies these two conditions, then  &alpha; is equal to the regression 
coefficient &beta;<sub>YX.Z</sub>
Conversely, if Z does not satisfy these conditions, then &beta;<sub>YX.Z</sub> 
is not a consistent estimand of &alpha;
(Chen &amp; Pearl, 2014, p. 10).
</p>

<p>Let's start to illuminate this definition using our examples.</p>

<p class="exercise">
All graphs on this page are clickable; clicking on a variable shows the effect of 
conditioning on it, i.e., including it into the set Z.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Model 1</h3>

<p>We first consider a simple mediation model.</p>
<pre class="dagitty mediumg-oneline">
M 1 @-0.361,-0.183
X E @-1.884,-0.236
Y O @1.091,-0.125

M Y
X M
</pre>

<p>
This model is clearly identified, and has positive degrees of freedom. 
Also the single-door criterion tells us that the parameter 
on the path X &rarr; M is identified 
because after removing the path X &rarr; M, X becomes unconditionally separated 
(i.e., conditionally separated given the empty set Z={}) from M:
</p>

<pre class="dagitty mediumg-oneline">
M 1 @-0.361,-0.183
X E @-1.884,-0.236
Y O @1.091,-0.125

M Y
</pre>

<p>
The parameter M &rarr; Y is also identified for the same reason.
</p>

<h3>Model 2</h3>

<p>We now add a direct effect to the simple mediation model.</p>
<pre class="dagitty mediumg-twolines">
M 1 @-0.354,-0.559
X 1 @-1.884,-0.236
Y 1 @1.041,-0.270

M Y
X M Y
</pre>

<p>
This model is just-identified (df=0). The coefficient 
X &rarr; M is identified as when we remove the path X &rarr; M,
we get
</p>
<pre class="dagitty mediumg-twolines">
M O @-0.354,-0.559
X E @-1.884,-0.236
Y 1 @1.041,-0.270

M Y
X Y
</pre>

<p>and again, X and M are unconditionally separated. Importantly,
if we include Y into our set Z, this would violate the first condition
of the single-door criterion, as we get a biasing path from 
X to M via the collider Y:
<p>

<pre class="dagitty mediumg-twolines">
M O @-0.354,-0.559
X E @-1.884,-0.236
Y A @1.041,-0.270

M Y
X Y
</pre>

<p>
Hence, X &rarr; M is no longer identified
if Y is added to the regression.
</p>

<p>
The coefficient M &rarr; Y is identified as M and Y would become separated by holding X constant:
</p>

<pre class="dagitty mediumg-twolines">
M E @-0.354,-0.559
X A @-1.884,-0.236
Y O @1.041,-0.270

X M
X Y
</pre>

<p>
And finally, X &rarr; Y is also identified, as holding M constant separates X and Y.
</p>


<h3>Model 3</h3>

<p>
Now it becomes trickier: We add an error covariance between M and Y to 
model a confounder C that influences M and Y.

<pre class="dagitty largeg-threelines">
digraph G { 
M [pos="-0.521,-0.265"]
X [exposure,pos="-1.749,-0.238"]
Y [outcome,pos="1.029,-0.228"]
M &lt;-> Y [pos="0.645,-0.279"]
X -> Y
X -> M -> Y
}
</pre>

<p>
This model is un-identified with -1 df. Does this mean that we can not identify 
any coefficients? No, the single-door criterion tells us that we can anyway just regress
M on X to identify the coefficient X &rarr; M. Just to check, this is what the graph 
looks like after removing the X &rarr; M arrow:
</p>

<pre class="dagitty largeg-threelines">
dag G { 
M [outcome,pos="-0.521,-0.265"]
X [exposure,pos="-1.749,-0.238"]
Y [pos="1.029,-0.228"]
M &lt;-> Y [pos="0.645,-0.279"]
X -> Y
M -> Y
}
</pre>

<p>
Indeed, X and M are independent now, so the criterion is fulfilled. But what about
the other coefficients? Let us first check X &rarr; Y. After removing this path, we get
</p>

<div class="dagitty largeg-threelines">
dag G { 
M [pos="-0.521,-0.265"]
X [exposure,pos="-1.749,-0.238"]
Y [outcome,pos="1.029,-0.228"]
M &lt;-> Y [pos="0.645,-0.279"]
X -> M
M -> Y
}
</div>

<p>
and we see that X and Y are not separated. Our only chance to separate them would be
by conditioning on M, which does not work either -- we would close one path via M, but
open another one:
</p>

<div class="dagitty largeg-threelines">
dag G { 
M [adjusted,pos="-0.521,-0.265"]
X [exposure,pos="-1.749,-0.238"]
Y [outcome,pos="1.029,-0.228"]
M &lt;-> Y [pos="0.645,-0.279"]
X -> M
M -> Y
}
</div>

<p>
For the same reason, we cannot identify the error covariance M &#8596; Y using the 
single-door criterion.
</p>

<p>
<b>Conclusion:</b> The single-door criterion can help us identify some, but not all,
coefficients in un-identified structural equation models.
</p>

<h3>Model 4</h3>

<p>
Finally, let's add an instrument W for M to identify all coefficients:
</p>

<pre class="dagitty largeg-fourlines">
digraph G { 
M [pos="-0.521,-0.265"]
W [pos="-1.75,-0.3"]
X [pos="-1.75,-0.23"]
Y [pos="1.029,-0.228"]
M &lt;-> Y [pos="0.645,-0.279"]
W -> M
X -> M -> Y
X -> Y
}
</pre>

<p>
This model is again just-identied; when simulating it, all parameter estimates are correct.
But what will the single-door criterion tell us about the identifiability of the 
parameters?
</p>

<p>
The coefficient W &rarr; M (effect of the instrument) is identified as by deleting 
the referring path,  W becomes unconditionally independent from M:
</p>

<pre class="dagitty largeg-fourlines">
digraph G { 
M [outcome,pos="-0.521,-0.265"]
W [exposure,pos="-1.75,-0.3"]
X [pos="-1.75,-0.23"]
Y [pos="1.029,-0.228"]
M &lt;-> Y [pos="0.645,-0.279"]
X -> M -> Y
X -> Y
}
</pre>

<p>
In the same way, we can identify the coefficient X &rarr; M.
</p>

<p>
But what about X &rarr; Y? Here nothing has changed compared to model 3: The only candidate for
Z would be M - but again, holding M constant opens a path between X and Y via the 
collider M:
</p>

<pre class="dagitty largeg-fourlines">
digraph G { 
M [adjusted,pos="-0.521,-0.265"]
W [pos="-1.75,-0.3"]
X [exposure,pos="-1.75,-0.23"]
Y [outcome,pos="1.029,-0.228"]
W -> M 
M &lt;-> Y [pos="0.645,-0.279"]
X -> M -> Y
X -> Y
}
</pre>

<p>
For similar reasons, we cannot apply the criterion to the coefficients
M &rarr; Y and M &#8596; Y.
</p>

<h2>The bottom line</h2>

<p> When coefficients are not identifiable using the single-door criterion,
they can still be identifiable by other means, such as instrumental variables or even
by estimating the whole model.
