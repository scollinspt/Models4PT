<h1>Covariate Roles in DAGs</h1>
<p>This is based on lecture notes prepared together with 
<a href="https://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/clinical-population-science/staff/361/professor-mark-s-gilthorpe">
Mark Gilthorpe</a>
for his module "Advanced Modelling Strategies".</p>
<h2>Roles of Covariates in DAGs</h2>
<p>
In empirical studies we often distinguish two variables of interest: the
<b>exposure</b>, or independent variable, or cause, and the <b>outcome</b>, 
or dependent variable, or effect. Once these two special variables are 
selected, the other variables in the study (whether measured or not measured)
are called <b>covariates</b>.
</p>
<p>Covariates can be categorized into several roles; not all of these roles 
are mutually exclusive, but some are. We will define four of these roles
below; in our definition we will make use of 
<a href="index.html">kinship terminology</a>. In all of the following, we 
assume that X is the exposure and Y is the outcome.
</p>
<h3>Confounders</h3>
<p>Confounders are variables that is both 
an ancestor of  the exposure and an ancestor of the 
outcome (along a path that does not include the exposure). 
For instance, Z is a confounder in the following DAG:
</p>
<div class="dagitty mediumg-twolines" data-interactive="false">
dag {
X [exposure,pos="0.000,1.000"]
Y [outcome,pos="1.000,1.100"]
Z [pos="0.500,2.000"]
X -> Y
Z -> X
Z -> Y
}
</div>
<p>To understand why the restriction "along a path that does not lead via the 
exposure" in the definition above, consider the following example:
</p>
<div class="dagitty mediumg-twolines" data-interactive="false">
dag {
X [exposure,pos="0.000,1.000"]
Y [outcome,pos="1.000,1.100"]
Z [pos="0.500,2.000"]
X -> Y
Z -> X
}
</div>

<p>
Here, Z is no longer a confounder, even though it is an ancestor of both
the exposure and the outcome. This is because the only path from Z to Y
leads through the exposure X.
</p>

<h3>Mediators</h3>

<p>
A <b>mediator</b> is a variable that lies "between" the exposure and 
the outcome; in other words, it is a descendant of the exposure and an
ancestor of the outcome. M is a mediator in the following example:
</p>

<div class="dagitty mediumg-oneline" data-interactive="false">
dag {
M [pos="0.500,1.050"]
X [exposure,pos="0.000,1.000"]
Y [outcome,pos="1.000,1.100"]
M -> Y
X -> M
}
</div>

<p>
A mediator cannot be a confounder. Can you explain why?
</p>

<h3>Proxy Confounders</h3>

<p>
Proxy confounders are covariates that are not themselves confounders, but
lie "between" confounders and the exposure or outcome. In other words, a proxy
confounder is a descendant of a confounder and an ancestor of either the
exposure or the outcome (but not both; else it would be a confounder).
</p>

<p>
In the example below, Z is a confounder and A and M are proxy confounders.
Note that M is also a mediator; the roles as mediator and proxy confounder
are not mutually exclusive.
</p>

<div class="dagitty largeg-threelines" data-interactive="false">
dag {
A [pos="0.700,1.500"]
M [pos="0.500,0.000"]
X [exposure,pos="0.000,1.000"]
Y [outcome,pos="1.000,1.100"]
Z [pos="0.350,2.000"]
A -&gt; Y
M -&gt; Y
X -&gt; M
Z -&gt; A
Z -&gt; M
Z -&gt; X
}
</div>

<h3>Competing Exposures</h3>

<p>
Lastly, a competing exposure is an ancestor of the outcome that is not related
with the exposure -- i.e., it is neither a confounder, nor a proxy confounder,
nor a mediator. Including competing exposures in a regression model does not
affect bias, but should improve precision.
</p>

<p>
In the two examples below, Z is a competing exposure.
</p>

<div class="dagitty mediumg-twolines" data-interactive="false">
dag {
X [exposure,pos="0.000,1.000"]
Y [outcome,pos="1.000,1.100"]
Z [pos="0.500,2.000"]
X -&gt; Y
Z -&gt; Y
}
</div>

<div class="dagitty largeg-twolines" data-interactive="false">
dag {
A [pos="0.350,2.000"]
X [exposure,pos="0.000,1.000"]
Y [outcome,pos="1.000,1.100"]
Z [pos="0.700,2.000"]
X -&gt; A
X -&gt; Y
Z -&gt; A
Z -&gt; Y
}
</div>
