        <h1>Models4PT &mdash; Clinically Relevant Causal Diagrams</h1>
        <p class="lead">
            Models4PT is built on the foundation of the DAGitty project, developed by Johannes Textor, to address 
            clinical and research needs in physical therapy and related fields. For more on the original project, 
            visit <a href="https://dagitty.net" target="_blank">dagitty.net</a>.

        <p class="lead">
			Models4PT provides an intuitive browser-based environment for creating, editing, and analyzing causal diagrams. 
			It builds upon the robust features of DAGitty while introducing enhancements specifically tailored for clinical 
			reasoning and research in physical therapy and related healthcare fields. 
		
			By leveraging critical realism principles, Models4PT incorporates deeper causal structures into modeling, allowing 
			researchers to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Identify and address sources of bias in empirical studies more effectively.</li>
			<li>Represent domains of causality (empirical, actual, real) for a more nuanced understanding of clinical phenomena (in development).</li>
			<li>Integrate nested and hierarchical submodels to reflect complex mechanisms in healthcare (in development).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			By adopting the user-friendly interface from DAGitty and focusing on PT applications, Models4PT bridges the gap between theoretical 
			frameworks and real-world research and clinical needs, empowering clinicians and researchers to design and analyze models that 
			reflect the multifaceted nature of clinical practice through clinical inquiry.
